Once upon a time there was a dog named Johnathan. He lived on a farm and loved all of the animals on the farm with him.
 The farmer was his best friend and the lamb was his enemy.

Jonathan was always by the farmer's side wherever he went.
One day, the lamb tried to disturb the farmer as he was working.
Jonathan did not stay still. He ran to the farmer and protected him.
He was the hero of the day. 

Everyone is dancing laughing singing around Jonathan. Jonathan was so proud of what he did. 
To show his brave, he suddenly attack lamb hardly. The lamb started bledding and died few seconds later.
